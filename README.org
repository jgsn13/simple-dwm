#+TITLE: dwm - dynamic window manager
#+DESCRIPTION: dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


* Requirements
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


* Installation
1. Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

2. Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):
#+begin_src bash
make clean install
#+end_src

* Running dwm
- Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:
#+begin_src bash
exec dwm
#+end_src

- In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

#+begin_src bash
DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm
#+end_src

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

- In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm

- Or just add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm_status_bar using startx:

#+begin_src bash
exec dwm_status_bar
#+end_src

* Configuration
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
